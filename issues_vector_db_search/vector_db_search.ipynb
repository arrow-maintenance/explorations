    "This notebook can be used to do a vector DB search of Arrow issues.  This allows for semantic searchâ€”retrieving issues based on meaning rather than exact keyword matches. This differs from GitHub's built-in search, which is mostly lexical and relies on specific terms, labels, or filters. A vector DB can surface issues with similar intent or topic even if they use different wording, making it more useful for detecting duplicates, related bugs, or thematic clusters."

Of course we would keep all low-level conversions (e.g. everything that lives in C++) at the array-level, but a large part of  could live in pandas.\n",
      "Some reasons to do this:\n",
      "- It's a lot of pandas specific code that might \"fit\" better in pandas itself\n",
      "- It would allow pandas to control the conversion more tightly\n",
      "  - Example: now with upcoming pandas 3.0 and the new string dtype, pandas could ensure to use that new dtype in any conversion, while now with older versions of pyarrow  will still give object dtype (\n",
      "- The required low-level functionality in pyarrow should now also be stable enough to allow having this code live in pandas itself (which might not have been the case at the inception of pyarrow)\n",
      "- (it would be a good reason to clean up that code thoroughly, which it can use ..)\n",
      "A potential downside is that it makes the dependency structure even more complex (pyarrow's  relying on pandas relying on pyarrow), although we already have infrastructure set up to lazily import pandas.\n",
      "The idea is not that we would change any public pyarrow API that supports pandas (ingesting pandas in various constructors,  methods on objects), but that at least for the DataFrame and Series level, we under the hood rely on a method from pandas to do that conversion. \n",
      "For example, I think that most of the handling of the \"pandas metadata\" (to guarantee a better pandas <-> arrow roundtrip) could live in pandas itself.\n",
      "Eventually that would allow us to remove a lot of this pandas compatibility code from pyarrow, but note that this is very much a long term goal as we will need to keep that code around until we drop support for all pandas versions older than the version that would add this functionality to pandas.  \n",
